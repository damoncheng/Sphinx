    next term
        Description.

    | These lines are
    | broken exactly like in

This is a normal text paragraph. The next paragraph is a code sample::

    It is not processed in any way, except

    It can span multiple lines.

This is a normal text paragraph again.

a directive is a generic block of explicit markup. Besides roles, it is one of the extension mechanism 
of reST, and Sphinx makes heavy use of it.

a directive consists of a **name**, **arguments**, **options** and **content**.


.. function:: foo(x)
              foo(y, z)

   :module: some.module.name

   Return a line of text input from the user
